MicroarrayAnalysis_JHUFall21 

This analysis pipeline was completed as part of the final project for 
AS.410.671 - Gene Expression Data Analysis and Visualization under Dr. Brandon
Higgs in Fall 2021.

This project analyzed Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array data using a 
sample set of cancerous and normal tissues taken from children/young adults 
with papillary thyroid cancer who either were (RE) or were not (NRE) exposed 
to radiation as a result of the Chernobyl disaster as a child.
